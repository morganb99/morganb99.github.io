# morganb99-mywebsite
a test website for me to mess around with and if successful make a 90s, minimal, crappy looking html site with my social info and maybe post about different things.

Also I'm sure I'll be reluctant to accept pull requests because I don't completely know how they work and I'd only really take it if it makes the styling much cleaner cause I know it can use some cleaning up. I only really have the repo public because it's more work to push changes when it's private.

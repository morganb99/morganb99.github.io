	<p style="space-item">12-14-23 - linux is fun. i been using fedora linux for a month or two because i couldn't get my games going on arch linux which i been using for 2 or 3 years. i figured it out tho and i am now on my usual arch linux hyprland setup. </p>	
<hr>
	<p style="space-item">9-25-23 - Still here. xP started new semester, dreading having to take calculus eventually. Also got another unlisted video flagged. At this point it's more of a curiousity to me. I'll edit another video up soon I know my last video is from like 10 days ago. Wasn't able to get to school today so I got almost all my assignments done that were almost or already due.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">7-28-23 - Puzzled that YouTube age restricted one my videos. It was an unlisted one I made while back that's like 10 seconds long. Just appealed it to see what happens not that it matters much unless they get retribution on me like they did with some other YouTuber. I got stuff on rumble anyway.</p>
	<p style="space-item">Update, I was able to get it off.</p>

	<p style="space-item">7-16-23 - In the process of making pictures smaller on this site. Found this ezgif site it makes it easy to do. The GIFs I shrunk down and some the other pictures are optimized. I was opening the site on Kmelon on windows 2000 on a pentium iii and it crashed. xP The GIFs are too big on small resolutions anyway. Also I might want to make a script to automatically put syntax around what I want to say idk.</p>
	<p style="space-item">Trying to get a v3i moto razr. Even got a sim card from us mobile in hopes that it won't just be stuck asking for one it likes. Finished taking a summer class and I will have a few more starting late august. Applying for jobs too.</p>
	<p style="space-item">Tried this site after shrinking down the gif's on the main page. Still slow but doesn't crash Kmelon now. I notice it has to load from other sites like some staticclick or whatever cause this is github. I wasn't interested in neocities because the security is still the same on there but maybe I can experiment on there now. Or I can find some geekier self hosted way of doing it that costs a little money idk.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">4-4-23 - Doing a little update to the site. I have switched around laptops recently and also been trying to get into my huddles, or clash or byte, whatever its called lmao. I can't get in on my phone or the computer. Also I have my videos synced on rumble now. Wish I could get them on odysee but oh well. I have a new AMD laptop with dedicated graphics and now using hyprland which is for wayland. Also adjusting the about me page, so if the wording seems awkward that's why.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">9-9-22 - Starting second year of college. I've bought a second galaxy s8 but this one is the europe model so i can unlock the bootloader and install some form of lineage os. Also messing with Windows Whistler and Longhorn on the pentium iii pc. I have one part of a series up so far but I need to edit the second part. Often times I am actually busy or I'm busy being tired, so it's easier to make streams. I have been using Gentoo on my laptop and PC and actually know what I'm doing somewhat. Got proton to work properly too so and fixed the save file situation with Amnesia AWFP so I can eventually stream me playing the second level.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">7-10-22 - Still alive, just thought making a website this way would be cool, just now burned out. Look at my instagram. Actually working on Gentoo again on my ROG laptop, I can't get optimus-manager to work yet but I figured out how to use overlays and I better understand package.use. Done with college until late august and I'll have camp and driver's ed in between, hopefully.</p>
	<p style="space-item">Also I've had a pentium ii gateway for a while. Long story but it's now a pentium iii and I been messing with windows 2000 on it. I managed to load this site with palemoon although i could probably still do it with kernelex on windows 98. That's what I had been using on it before windows 2000 just on two different hard drives. I know from past expierence dual booting the two is really touchy just because of the nature of the two.</p>
	<p style="space-item">Also got a galaxy s8 and I actually like it a lot too.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">5-5-22 - Hi, I'm still alive, I'm either tired or working on college stuff.. I have some videos on YouTube and I am working on eventually having videos on Odysee. I need to anyway in case I get suspended on YouTube again. I have a Galaxy s21 now and I don't plan on updating my about me page with new stuff anytime soon.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">4-5-22 - Not going to have my Odysee channel for a while. I got the YouTube channel to finally sync but it makes it a separate channel from what I already have. I removed both but I think the videos stays saying they're from an Anonymous. Idk I'll probably try to sync again or delete my account and try again. I only follow like three channels anyway, maybe the anonymous videos will come later. Might get a Galaxy s21 hand me down soon too in a week or two.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">3-20-22 - Dealing with college especially midterms until this week which I got off because of spring break. I got a Dell Pentium 4 off the sidewalk and I been messing with it while waiting for my Pentium II parts to come in. I doubt I'm going to update the about me pages anytime soon. Next time I do I ought to make the computers on their own pages.</p>

	<p style="space-item">2-16-22 - I am really learning my lession right now in college. 4 classes is a lot for me, especially pre calculus. I have to stay on top of everthing. Definitely doing only like 3 next semester.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">2-11-22 - A lot of things have happened. My main YouTube channel is back. After talking to Team YouTube they showed me a form to fill out to say that my channel was hijacked and what do you know, maybe a day or two later it was back. Someone was definitely in there though, the name and profile picture was changed, and a lot of videos were set to private. Very glad but I will now and then upload videos to my Odysee. Also got a wiimote in for my wii and hacked the system so know I can play a bunch of stuff on it. Started playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on my PC. It uses so much computing power I doubt I'd be able to stream it. I might be able to stream 2b2t though if I get a lot of free time again. The queue only seems to be around 400 although the estimated time said 9 hours so I don't know. Got a lot of things from online and from Goodwill too look on my Instagram.
    <hr>
	<p style="space-item">1-18-22 - Added a few of the videos from the new channel to my Odysee. If i remember to add the the odysee channel it'll be in the contact me page. I should change the name of that page, I'm not sure. It really turned more into links for everything, some of which you can use to contact me. Also made a neocities page which I may use to test things like having the domain be one there. I want to see if I can undo some of the github.io security standards so the site can maybe work on older versions of Internet Explorer. Also found info on one of my old videos on some other video which I was suprised to see.</p>

	<p style="space-item">1-10-22 - I still have this week off before I go back to school so yeah I could stream but my allergies are getting really bad again. Maybe if they get better. I probably still stream after I go back though because it's been put back on Zoom due to the major increase in cases lately. Kinda sounds like last semester hehe, first two weeks on Zoom and not even knowing if it's just going to be extended.</p>

	<p style="space-item">1-9-22 - New video up, I replace the battery in my Oneplus 7 Pro in my hermit hole bedroom and desk.</p>
	<a href="https://youtu.be/Q-P7GxsdEgM">Replacing Oneplus battery, got rid of embedded player</a>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">1-3-22 - Just got the battery in for my Oneplus 7 Pro from iFixit and replaced it. Also took a crappy angle video of me doing it I'll have to look at it later, try editing it and maybe I'll upload it. Also published the little video I was talking about in the last post and did a 40 minute or so long stream. My allergies are pretty bad, probably have a cold or something but medicine is helping for the most part. You could probably hear me sniffing in the video idk. I also reinstalled Arch Linux on my main Vivobook laptop too, what I did was create a partition for the new install and then as I move files from the old partition to the new one I resize the old one so I have space on the new with gparted live. I try not to change partitions too often as I'm pretty sure that's how I killed the original SSD in my ROG laptop but I do change it from time to time. Also didn't help that it was a 1TB SSD (oof) but as the capacity is bigger the more you have to shuffle data around and the reads and writes you have to do increases, if that makes any sense. The ROG now has a 256GB SSD and the Vivobook has a 500GB SSD, and I occasionally check the health of the drives with smartctl.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">1-1-22 - Happy new years everyone. Wish you the best.</p>
	<p>I took it for granted that I was finally going to get help via email to get an answer as to what is up with my YouTube but no one contacted me back even though I was told only to wait up to 24 hours. It's been more like 2, 3 days and I could talk to Google One support again but that'd have to be some other day. Really pissed off at Google and I just wish I could at least get some videos back so I can upload them to Odysee as I occasionally like to watch videos on there as many notable people have posted their material there. I had like 7 years worth of video on there and it's all gone pretty much.</p>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDNqhZ0SLv97CaRKJCeRtlw">Link to my new channel</a>
	<p>I have a video prepared already that is unlisted that I will publish later and I will have a little bit of time alone next week so I can maybe get another stream or two out then. I had been depending on going to my dad's house to stream because it's quiet there at night and noone else is home but that's kind off ifffy so I have even more incentive after the winter break to actually work and edit together videos.</p>
	<p>Also I been wanting to replace the battery in the Oneplus 7 pro even though the back is sealed on. I was able to get it off with careful prying without cracking it. Look on my Instagram and you can see more about it. I have a battery coming in from iFixit and later on I'll get a see through back glass too.</p>
	<p>Also I've had this same cheap Red dragon mechanical keyboard and I noticed it's starting to give out on me. The 7 key is a bit wobbly but that was my fault. But recently the F and tab key are starting to do like a Macbook butterfly keyboard on me. When I press them they are sometimes intermittent or register twice. I don't see it as a big enough issue yet but if it gets bad enough I'll probably buy another one or go back to my Razer Ornata Chroma. I know a keyboard online I saw that is $30 and has the cherry mx brown keys compared to the mx blues in my current keyboard. It'll be interesting to see what the difference is. That will be eventually though, first I need cables and peripherals for my Wii to see if it'll work. I kept forgetting that the Xbox I got from Goodwill was sealed so there was it definitely has the original optical drive so I swapped the drives but soldered in the old board. Now that drive has been in 3 Xboxes and now it works. Got the dust off the fans with wipees too.</p>

	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">12-28-21 - The last post was when I got my dual monitor setup back. Also got my Yoshino figure back too. Hope you've had a good Christmas. I got a few diffferent things especially since it was my 19th birthday too.</p>

	<p>I went to a Goodwill electronics store and got an Xbox 360 elite and a Wii. I don't have the right cables or controller to set the Wii up yet but since I already have an old Xbox 360 I was able to test the elite model. I'm kinda upset because it won't read my games even though it says on the label that it was tested and works. I took it apart and cleaned it but it still didn't work. I suspect that they swapped the optical drive and only tested a DVD which would make it impossible for a game to play on it without swapping back in the original driver board. Hopefully I can return it, get my money back and buy the other one they had if it has an HDMI port, which is what I mostly bought it for as I wanted a system with more HDD capacity and an HDMI port. My launch model isn't hackable either afaik with a modchip.</p>

	<p>My morganb900 YouTube channel is still suspended and I am about to talk with Google One support to see if anything can be done. If they still don't bring it back then I will update the contact page to show my new channel. I know it's a semi big deal because my video on my second channel with the morganb900 name in it got 900 or so views so I know that's how many people likely got it while trying to look for my channel.</p>

	<p style="space-item">12-4-21 - I haven't made any real changes lately and I guess I blame final exams. I will be done by next week though. I'm sure I will get less interested in the site too. Here is some links of some slight relevance. I found out about a cool web page through a YouTube video that generates sound called bytebeats depending on what code you put into it. I also have another test page I made maybe a week ago. I was trying to get sound to play in the background, even with simple Javascript. I wasn't able to get it to work so I'm sure I wasn't implementing the JS code correctly, I was just copying and pasting from different forums and websites. I'm sure you might be able to find some of my attempts in the Github commits. I think I was successful once but the way I tried only worked on the newest Internet Explorer.</p>
	<p style="space-item">Also I am still pissed my YouTube channel is suspended but I have submitted an appeal and hopefully they will get back to me soon.</p>

	<p style="space-item">11-21-21 - My YouTube channel must've gotten hacked because I got an email saying it got suspended. I can't login on YouTube and my channel gives a 404 page. As part of having Google One after the storage change with Google Photos I was able to get in touch with support chat and made an appeal. All I can do is wait and if they don't bring it back, then oh well, what else can I do?</p>
	<p style="space-item">Also got two iPhone 6's and a Nexus 7. Look on my Instagram later on for possible updates on this.</p>
	<p style="space-item">I have shipped back my FX 5200 and Radeon 7000 for return. I have ordered some GPU without much thought but idk if it'll work good for my use case on the Pentium.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">11-15-21 - I am going to try something I saw while looking at the github page for the polybar website. I will create a project with the same name as the site and if that works I can get this site to go to just morganb99.github.io instead of having to do the extra /mywebsite at the end. If I do get it going then I'll rename this site in a way that you can get here easier. I'll have a page at the /mywebsite so you won't just get a 404. It might take a while so just warning you now.</p>
	<p style="space-item">Ok I got it going now, although you can't say morganb99.github.io/mywebsite/ you must do it without the last slash.</p>
	<p style="space-item">Kind of pissed because of that issue. It's because of Jekyll 3 which Github pages uses and I don't understand it very well. We'll just deal with it for now. At least if someone can't figure it out and they have the Internet Archive addon they can see the old page.😆</p>
	<p style="space-item">Came up with a better idea. How about I attempt to reprogram the 404 page so you can get redirected home?</p>
	<p style="space-item">Spent so much time trying to figure out why the redirects still the old way but I figured it out I'm really stupid. I thought the old way was still in internal settings so I copied the repository and tried a bunch of other stuff but I THINK I got it now.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">11-13-21 - I really should be working on my college work right now but I just REALLY don't want to work on it sometimes. Part of it too is stress like it might not be due for a while but I pressure myself into thinking it has to be done ASAP. Anyway I got the new GPU in but it doesn't seem to work. Websites online say a 200 watt PSU is recommended so it doesn't make sense. It just has no signal. It still POSTs and I get some activity on the storage but it'll shut off after a minute or so. It'll need more testing later but oh well. I got more allowance and I might return the card or not. Either way I can get a new card eventually. The capacitors look fine too and I tried a lot of stuff too like unplugging the power to storage and unplugging the Soundblaster to reduce power draw but it didn't make a difference.</p>

    <p>
	Also I have been messing with Gentoo again in a VM. I have been messing with Gentoo several times then giving up for a while. It clearly isn't for me because tbere are too many choices with the USE flags to grasp but it is still intriguing. Every time I try again I pick up a couple more tips and get a little better. Here's what I got in a couple days. I was real bummed though when I was compiling a dependency of Qutebrowser and after a waiting A LOT the progress got to 20k/23k and then it failed. Better than compiling Firefox or Chromium I guess. It basically encourages you to use minimal software which in a way is a good thing.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>11-10-21 - Just realized I can double click on an html file and it'll open in Firefox, duh why was I using a seperate website for it? Also got a new update for Havoc OS on my phone which is the first time since I've installed it on my phone 2 or so months ago. I was so used to the updating on Lineage OS which I had before. It felt like you got one like every other week. Also I should learn how to use git pull but I'm too lazy so if it complains that I did a commit from a different computer so it isn't current anymore I delete the code and re clone it.</p>
	<p>Also have a lot of assignments in my classes, got a couple done this afternoon, I'll hopefully do most of the rest of the weekend. Also got tested again for COVID and it came back negative now, which I'm glad for. I bet it was a false positive but it's OK. I'll be able to come back on campus next week I'm sure.</p>

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morganb99/mywebsite/main/pictureindex/compress.png" alt="Compress" width="349" height="248">
	<p>11-8-21 - I used a website to compress the photos in the about me section. They are a bit crusty but OK. I guess I wanted to do that for old computers but Github kinda forces HTTPS and maybe it causes the ancient browsers to not work? This work could make sense later on if I end up with a good deal on a domain but I doubt it. Kinda funny they were originally 5-6mb and now they're like 60-200kb. I'll keep the picture wall the same and compress some of the post pictures down too perhaps. Also I am applying shadows to another page header text thingy, really tired so I'll look at it later and only change it if it looks REALLY ugly. The color needs to be dark to contrast from a light background. Later on I can experiment with different background colors besides black and white.</p>

	<p>11-6-21 - Still home from COVID, though I don't feel sick. Ordered a new GPU for my pentium computer, hopefully it does better. Also got the Soundblaster 16 in the mail and it works pretty good. Suprisingly, Duke Nukem 3D will only have both sound effects and music work in DOS mode not in Windows. Maybe someone more familiar can explain to me. Way better than with the last sound card which wouldn't work nearly as good because the Soundblaster compatability was hit and miss and it was either that or General MIDI.</p>
	<p>I was going to order the same card but with a different copyright year on it but I'm pretty sure my eBay account got messed with and I couldn't find the original.</p>
	<p>Looking at the repetitive nature of coding in new posts, I'm sure I can use some script inside the website to type in text fields my new posts but eh, not for a long time. Maybe after a couple more semesters in college.</p>
	<p>I also added links that I have found useful for working on this site. For software I use vim and git in the alacritty terminal with the Kate text editor. At any point I may test the site with Firefox, Chromium, surf, or Internet Explorer in some cases.</p>

	<p>11-2-21 - Using my Inspiron 5100 to move an app to my TI-84 that I use for class. I used to mess around with it A LOT in high school besides using it for academics. Whomp womp, also gotta stay home for COVID, I feel fine though so far. Haven't felt like watching anime in a long while, just started watching watamote, feels sort of relatable, she has a hard time being social outside her family.</p>

	<p>11-1-21 - Got some more RAM (now 64mb from 32mb) and a new GPU (FX 5200 64bit VRAM) for the Pentium PC. It's not really period correct but I just wanted something different. One cool thing about it was the picture stopped being wobbly so it must've been the old GPU causing it. The capacitors on the new GPU are puffing though and the fan doesn't spin so I'm either going to fix it or get a new card in a week or two. The card likes to act up and 3D games don't really work with the two drivers I've tried so far. I also have a new cooler for the CPU coming in soon hopefully that will help. I was able to fix the controller ports on the PS2 but now the disc drive won't spin up. I accidentally yanked on the cable for the laser and must've messed it up even though the laser still moves.

	<p>10-27-21 - Have you ever felt like you've seen these people before? I feel like James Charles is the guy on the left, or the guy on the right is some stereotypical New York mobster. Kind of just posting just to post right now. I'm on my break at school and finished some work already. Working on the website to get my mind off of things. Does your heart ever just sink for no reason? Oh it's terrible when it happens.</p>

	<p>Oh yeah, and I brought my chunky Inspiron 5100 to math class yesterday and it was fun. Used it to do my math work and it was suprisingly usable. With the Mypal browser and Windows XP, Canvas and Connectmath worked good but ALEKS was a bit slow though.</p>

	<p>10-26-21 - Really busy right now with school stuff.. Might add a thing or two before or during this upcoming weekend, like adding more of my devices in the about me section. Got some stuff coming in the mail, hopefully going to fix the wobbly picture I was getting on the Pentium computer but I'm not sure.

	<p>10-25-21 - During my break at college I found a "flaming text" site that makes these cheesy images with whatever text you want. Might use this somewhere eventually. Also I approve of the Surf browser for once. It's nice for slightly more immediate feedback on whether something works if the circumstance kept me from being able to test in an HTML testing site. It doesn't cache the site if you've been there before already so you will see the most recent changes as soon as possible.</p>

	<p>10-24-21 - I've been playing on the 21w42a snapshot of Minecraft and it is quite a treat. Also went to church which I barely do now and then for the experience.</p>
	<p>Moved some files around in the website's github repo so might take some time and a few commits to fix a picture that I forgot to change the link for. And I don't see the point of having different branches if I can't monitor the master branch privately and have an older one be the one that is public to everyone. I'm sure something like that exists but I don't know how to do it yet so if you come here while I'm working on stuff it may be a little broken and you will have to come back in like 10 minutes for me to unbreak it.</p>

	<p style="space-item">10-22-21 - I have been trying to get this Zip disk drive to work that I've had for a while. Just got a zip disk for it but the lights just keep blinking. I think it's cause the power supply I try with it is the wrong voltage. I need to find all the pieces to my universal power adapter. It's super weird because it has a USB A port and barrel power jack. It says on the label it needs 5 volts but I thought you can usually get that much at least about of USB?</p>
	<p>It's so crazy, I just found the same exact model and at buy it now price it is $91. I guess I'm either fixing what I got or I'm giving up. I'd rather get a 1TB SSD for that much.😆</p>

    <p>Also happy anniversary to Windows 7 and early 20th anniversary to Windows XP! Tons of good times I had with it recently and back then.</p>

	<p><small>This essay in general is about comparing and contrasting. I was going to do cats and dogs at first but we had to use the teacher's pre-approved topics and after thinking, cats and dogs felt too rudamentary. Doesn't matter too much just get me the 80!</small></p>
	<p style="space-item">10-20-2021 - Pretty much done with my essay, just need a title but I got until tomorrow night for that. Pissed though because I will have my research paper soon after. Maybe I can have a theme where I have 3 200x200 gifs I get going on at the top of the main page and have a little related message before. I already feel like these orbs are just meh. Too much moving around but I sitll need GIFs to give this a 90/2000s feel. Idk I'm probably failing miserably at that, it's OK.</p>
	<p>On another note, I feel pretty good that at least the text shows last time I viewed the site in the Lynx browser. It's just as good as you can get for a TEXT ONLY browser. Also tested to see what happens if you don't do "git add ." before commiting a new picture in and it does what I expected, it will fail to load in and just use the alt text.</p>

	<p style="space-item">10-19-2021 - Just tried the site on Internet Explorer 11 and it looks like my grid container doesn't work. I guess it's a part of HTML 5 and Internet Explorer just doesn't know how to use that new HTML version. Oh well, I guess if you are using Windows XP use a browser like Mypal or try something else. I'm just glad it shows mostly good, should work on Windows 98 and older but I can't tell because I dont have Internet on my old system. I'll make a virtual machine later on and see how much more broken it is.

	<p style="space-item">10-19-2021 - I'm sort of torn on which orb I should keep on the main page.. I might just keep it the way it is for now... lol I have an essay to work on by Thursday but I've got most of it done in one sitting. Also might just be cheesy with the way I talk in the about me page, that's just the way I feel. Like oh, I like the Pentium 166, or oh I like cats. Also how do I center something on the page? I try align but that only does so much. Is that what the meme is I see? How do center a div??</p>

    <p style="space-item">10-18-2021 - Doesn't really seem appropriate to have black and white switched in the about me page but I want to learn more. Might change it back when I work on it more, idk it's a slow and tedious process, working on this. Tryit editor really helps though.</p>
	<hr>
    <p style="space-item">10-17-2021 - Posts to come! They'll be further down the page. Also while working on this, I've been learning HTML for the first time since middle school.</p>

	<p style="space-item">10-20-2021 - Pretty much done with my essay, just need a title but I got until tomorrow night for that. Maybe Ii can have a theme for 3 200x200 gifs I get going on at the top of the main page and have a little related message before. I already feel like these orbs are just meh. Too much moving around but I sitll need GIFs to give this a 90/2000s feel. Idk I'm probably failing miserably at that, it's OK.</p>

	<p style="space-item">10-19-2021 - Just tried the site on Internet Explorer 11 and it looks like my grid container doesn't work. I guess it's a part of HTML 5 and Internet Explorer just doesn't know how to use that new HTML version. Oh well, I guess if you are using Windows XP use a browser like Mypal or try something else. I'm just glad it shows mostly good, should work on Windows 98 and older but I can't tell because I dont have Internet on my old system. I'll make a virtual machine later on and see how much more broken it is.

	<p style="space-item">10-19-2021 - I'm sort of torn on which orb I should keep on the main page.. I might just keep it the way it is for now... lol I have an essay to work on by Thursday but I've got most of it done in one sitting. Also might just be cheesy with the way I talk in the about me page, that's just the way I feel. Like oh, I like the Pentium 166, or oh I like cats. Also how do I center something on the page? I try align but that only does so much. Is that what the meme is I see? How do center a div??</p>

    <p style="space-item">10-18-2021 - Doesn't really seem appropriate to have black and white switched in the about me page but I want to learn more. Might change it back when I work on it more, idk it's a slow and tedious process, working on this. Tryit editor really helps though.</p>
	<hr>
    <p style="space-item">10-17-2021 - Posts to come! They'll be further down the page. Also while working on this, I've been learning HTML for the first time since middle school.</p>

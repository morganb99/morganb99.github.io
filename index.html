	<p>10-27-21 - Have you ever felt like you've seen these people before? I feel like James Charles is the guy on the left, or the guy on the right is some stereotypical New York mobster. Kind of just posting just to post right now. I'm on my break at school and finished some work already. Working on the website to get my mind off of things. Does your heart ever just sink for no reason? Oh it's terrible when it happens.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>10-26-21 - Really busy right now with school stuff.. Might add a thing or two before or during this upcoming weekend, like adding more of my devices in the about me section. Got some stuff coming in the mail, hopefully going to fix the wobbly picture I was getting on the Pentium computer but I'm not sure.

	<p>10-25-21 - During my break at college I found a "flaming text" site that makes these cheesy images with whatever text you want. Might use this somewhere eventually. Also I approve of the Surf browser for once. It's nice for slightly more immediate feedback on whether something works if the circumstance kept me from being able to test in an HTML testing site. It doesn't cache the site if you've been there before already so you will see the most recent changes as soon as possible.</p>

	<p>10-24-21 - I've been playing on the 21w42a snapshot of Minecraft and it is quite a treat. Also went to church which I barely do now and then for the experience.</p>
	<p>Moved some files around in the website's github repo so might take some time and a few commits to fix a picture that I forgot to change the link for. And I don't see the point of having different branches if I can't monitor the master branch privately and have an older one be the one that is public to everyone. I'm sure something like that exists but I don't know how to do it yet so if you come here while I'm working on stuff it may be a little broken and you will have to come back in like 10 minutes for me to unbreak it.</p>

	<p style="space-item">10-22-21 - I have been trying to get this Zip disk drive to work that I've had for a while. Just got a zip disk for it but the lights just keep blinking. I think it's cause the power supply I try with it is the wrong voltage. I need to find all the pieces to my universal power adapter. It's super weird because it has a USB A port and barrel power jack. It says on the label it needs 5 volts but I thought you can usually get that much at least about of USB?</p>
	<p>It's so crazy, I just found the same exact model and at buy it now price it is $91. I guess I'm either fixing what I got or I'm giving up. I'd rather get a 1TB SSD for that much.ðŸ˜†</p>

    <p>Also happy anniversary to Windows 7 and early 20th anniversary to Windows XP! Tons of good times I had with it recently and back then.</p>

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morganb99/mywebsite/main/pictureindex/engl.png" alt="It's ok you can't see the essay it's just OK.">
	<p><small>This essay in general is about comparing and contrasting. I was going to do cats and dogs at first but we had to use the teacher's pre-approved topics and after thinking, cats and dogs felt too rudamentary. Doesn't matter too much just get me the 80!</small></p>
	<p style="space-item">10-20-2021 - Pretty much done with my essay, just need a title but I got until tomorrow night for that. Pissed though because I will have my research paper soon after. Maybe I can have a theme where I have 3 200x200 gifs I get going on at the top of the main page and have a little related message before. I already feel like these orbs are just meh. Too much moving around but I sitll need GIFs to give this a 90/2000s feel. Idk I'm probably failing miserably at that, it's OK.</p>
	<p>On another note, I feel pretty good that at least the text shows last time I viewed the site in the Lynx browser. It's just as good as you can get for a TEXT ONLY browser. Also tested to see what happens if you don't do "git add ." before commiting a new picture in and it does what I expected, it will fail to load in and just use the alt text.</p>
	<hr>
	<p style="space-item">10-19-2021 - Just tried the site on Internet Explorer 11 and it looks like my grid container doesn't work. I guess it's a part of HTML 5 and Internet Explorer just doesn't know how to use that new HTML version. Oh well, I guess if you are using Windows XP use a browser like Mypal or try something else. I'm just glad it shows mostly good, should work on Windows 98 and older but I can't tell because I dont have Internet on my old system. I'll make a virtual machine later on and see how much more broken it is.

	<p style="space-item">10-19-2021 - I'm sort of torn on which orb I should keep on the main page.. I might just keep it the way it is for now... lol I have an essay to work on by Thursday but I've got most of it done in one sitting. Also might just be cheesy with the way I talk in the about me page, that's just the way I feel. Like oh, I like the Pentium 166, or oh I like cats. Also how do I center something on the page? I try align but that only does so much. Is that what the meme is I see? How do center a div??</p>
	<hr>
    <p style="space-item">10-18-2021 - Doesn't really seem appropriate to have black and white switched in the about me page but I want to learn more. Might change it back when I work on it more, idk it's a slow and tedious process, working on this. Tryit editor really helps though.</p>
	<hr>
    <p style="space-item">10-17-2021 - Posts to come! They'll be further down the page. Also while working on this, I've been learning HTML for the first time since middle school.</p>

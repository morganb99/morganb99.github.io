	<p style="color:white" class="space-item">Maybe later on I'll be better at introducing myself. I'm 18 and I am studying in college to learn computer programming. I am pretty much obsessed with electronics and nostalgia so I work with new and old computer games. I also like Asian stuff and love my two cats at least some of the time. I can read a bit of Japanese and Spanish but I'm not very good at speaking it. I also use Arch Linux a lot. I will use Windows from time to time when I need more battery life on my laptop during class or I'm playing certain games but I love using the terminal, especially to write this very code in Vim or Kate. I also played the violin for a pretty long time and I was OK at it. Got too burned out and didn't want to play it anymore but perhaps I'll get into it again some other time. Maybe guitar instead because I like my 2000s rock/metal.</p>

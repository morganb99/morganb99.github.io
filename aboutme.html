	<p  class="space-item">Maybe later on I'll be better at introducing myself. I'm 18 and I am studying in college to learn computer programming. I am pretty much obsessed with electronics and nostalgia so I work with new and old computer games. I also like Asian stuff and love my two cats at least some of the time. I can read a bit of Japanese and Spanish but I'm not very good at speaking it. I also use Arch Linux a lot. I will use Windows from time to time when I need more battery life on my laptop during class or I'm playing certain games but I love using the terminal, especially to write this very code in Vim or Kate. I also played the violin for a pretty long time and I was OK at it. Got too burned out and didn't want to play it anymore but perhaps I'll get into it again some other time. Maybe guitar instead because I like my 2000s rock/metal.</p>

			<p>Got it a year or two ago. I've broken the plastic around the top of the screen and broke the latch holding in the optical drive. Also the middle click on the keyboard doesn't work after getting two scrap keyboards from China but oh well. It's a very neat laptop from 7 or so years ago and it's what I used before I got my ROG laptop in mid 2020.</p>

			<p>500GB HDD, Arch Linux and Windows 7. Used to have Windows XP but it got a bit corrupted. I also have a 200gb NTFS partition to keep files in so they are easily accessable from all operating systems. Battery life is about as bad as my ROG, like almost two hours even with a replacement battery I got.</p>

            <p>Battery used to last 2 minutes now it's cooked. The CMOS battery has died recently too. Fun laptop to burn CDs, play DVDs, trying to play games and do other stuff. I used to actually do my school work on it few years ago, browsing the Internet and everything. If I wanted to watch YouTube I'd use a website to download the video in 360p and watch in VLC. I programmed in Java for computer science and robotics on it. Better than using a Lenovo Chromebook with LANSchool spyware on it.</p>

			<p>Not Windows 11 supported btw, all the more reason to use Linux on it. But ever since I got a new SSD on it GRUB will cease to exist every time the computer is force shutdown.</p>

			<p>Gigabyte AX370M-DS3H</p>
			<p>HP Pavillion 2560x1440 60Hz monitor</p>
			<p>Arch Linux btw and Windows 10, although the latter has broken updates and only really used for streaming GTAV chaos and even then that's getting hard lately because it likes to spazz out.</p>
			<p>7200 RPM 1TB WD Blue, used to have two working ones but I moved partitions around so much I fried them but managed to fix one by swapping the driver boards. I actually have two of this computer but one has a fried CPU as well as the fried HDD, yeah. Only real difference is one has an MSI motherboard I think instead of Gigabyte but both came with 8gb of RAM so now I have 16gb DDR4 which is pretty safe standard for me.</p>

			<p>Diamond Stealth 3D 2000 Pro with 2MB VRAM although might get a Riva128 and a better CPU cooler later on.</p>
			<p>C-Media CMI8738 Sound card, mostly using for its soundblaster compatability and General MIDI support. May get a real Soundblaster 16 far down the line because some DOS games don't like my current card.</p>
			<p>Sometimes I will hook up IDE floppy drive and IDE CD-RW drive but most of the time I get away with mounting ISOs. If I try to play something like Command and Conquer from CD it'll just lock up but if I mount the ISO it works fine.</p>
			<p>I've been looking for a case to house it but right now they're too expensive and I'm not even sure I'll get the right one. Also the video output is very wobbly and wavy after I busted the last power supply. Hopefully it'll be fixed once I buy the different video card.</p>

			<h2>Oneplus 7 Pro</h2>
			<p>I've had this since about Feburary and it is an EXCELLENT phone for the most part. I have Havoc OS on it now and I love the screen covering the whole phone and the front camera coming out of the top. I am very anxious about a lot of things and it is nice knowing for sure when the front camera is being used. My dad had this phone before me and when he had it I had the Oneplus 7T which is also an excellent phone too. Oh and did I mention the 30 watt fast charge and in screen finger print sensor? I am sad there is no headphone jack but yeah I have to deal with it. Might need to get a new dongle because the right side gets static and I like to use my Sennheiser HD280's with my phone sometimes. The battery could use a replacement too but I still get away with 10-20% at the end of the day. I stay up at night or wake up early anyway so I blame it on myself, not the phone.</p>

			<h2>iPhone 4s</h2>
			<p>To me it's basically a smaller iPhone 13. Tons of nostalgia from when my dad had the iPhone 4 when it was new. I have one that I broke the battery connector and another still running iOS 6 without any Coolbooter kerfuffle. I love the old design of iOS, I love tinkering with it, and I love to look the many things that are still possible to do on it.<p>

			<p>It's the original Xenon model on latest firmware and there aren't any mod chips I know of that will work on it. It has a 20gb hdd on it and I have one of the wireless controllers with the chatpad. I had the xbox 360 a lot before this one so I already have a bunch of games digitally and on disc. Occasionally I play GTA IV on it because I never got to play it before and it is a pain to run a cracked copy on PC.</p>

			<h2>Asus VivoBook X712DA</h2>
			<p>A laptop I just got recently and it still has like terrible 3 hour battery life but it doesn't have the problems I had with Linux like the ROG laptop like it not waking from sleep or not syncing with NTP. The power supply is much smaller though and maybe some other time I can order a new battery to get more battery life. The ROG I bought a new battery for $40 and the battery life what still shit but I still want to try on this laptop.</p>
			<p>Ryzen 7 3700U CPU</p>
			<p>Radeon Vega Mobile integrated graphics. Plays Minecraft 1.18 multiplayer at 80fps.</p>
			<p>10GB RAM? Not sure though, Windows reported 12GB I would have to take apart the laptop more to see.</p>
			<p>1080p 60hz screen. Color is not as good as the ROG but still good. This laptop is a little bit bigger than the ROG so the screen is bigger. There is a numberpad that I am not a fan of but I can still use the home/end and pg up/down keys in that area.</p>

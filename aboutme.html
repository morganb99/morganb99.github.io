	<p  class="space-item">Maybe later on I'll be better at introducing myself. I'm 18 and I am studying in college to learn computer programming. I am pretty much obsessed with electronics and nostalgia so I work with new and old computer games. I also like Asian stuff and love my two cats at least some of the time. I can read a bit of Japanese and Spanish but I'm not very good at speaking it. I also use Arch Linux a lot. I will use Windows from time to time when I need more battery life on my laptop during class or I'm playing certain games but I love using the terminal, especially to write this very code in Vim or Kate. I also played the violin for a pretty long time and I was OK at it. Got too burned out and didn't want to play it anymore but perhaps I'll get into it again some other time. Maybe guitar instead because I like my 2000s rock/metal.</p>

			<h2>Dell Inspiron 5100</h2>
            <p>Battery used to last 2 minutes now it's cooked. The CMOS battery has died recently too. Fun laptop to burn CDs, play DVDs, trying to play games and do other stuff. I used to actually do my school work on it few years ago, browsing the Internet and everything. If I wanted to watch YouTube I'd use a website to download the video in 360p and watch in VLC. I programmed in Java for computer science and robotics on it. Better than using a Lenovo Chromebook with LANSchool spyware on it.</p>
            <p>Windows XP SP3 and Arch Linux 32, although the latter is pretty unbearable because it locks up trying to compile polybar and because it is 32bit I can't throw a regular binary at it.</p>
            <p>1 core Pentium 4</p>
            <p>ATI Mobility Radeon 7500</p>
            <p>768MB DDR RAM? 120GB HDD? 1024x768 screen</p>
	    <p>I'd have to double check the specs. It used to have like 1.5GB of RAM but one of the sticks stopped working and kept it from booting.</p>

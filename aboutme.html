	<p  class="space-item">Maybe later on I'll be better at introducing myself. I'm 18 and I am studying in college to learn computer programming. I am pretty much obsessed with electronics and nostalgia so I work with new and old computer games. I also like Asian stuff and love my two cats at least some of the time. I can read a bit of Japanese and Spanish but I'm not very good at speaking it. I also use Arch Linux a lot. I will use Windows from time to time when I need more battery life on my laptop during class or I'm playing certain games but I love using the terminal, especially to write this very code in Vim or Kate. I also played the violin for a pretty long time and I was OK at it. Got too burned out and didn't want to play it anymore but perhaps I'll get into it again some other time. Maybe guitar instead because I like my 2000s rock/metal.</p>

			<h2>Dell Inspiron 5100</h2>
            <p>Battery used to last 2 minutes now it's cooked. The CMOS battery has died recently too. Fun laptop to burn CDs, play DVDs, trying to play games and do other stuff. I used to actually do my school work on it few years ago, browsing the Internet and everything. If I wanted to watch YouTube I'd use a website to download the video in 360p and watch in VLC. I programmed in Java for computer science and robotics on it. Better than using a Lenovo Chromebook with LANSchool spyware on it.</p>
            <p>Windows XP SP3 and Arch Linux 32, although the latter is pretty unbearable because it locks up trying to compile polybar and because it is 32bit I can't throw a regular binary at it.</p>
            <p>1 core Pentium 4</p>
            <p>ATI Mobility Radeon 7500</p>
            <p>1GB RAM, 110GB ish HDD, 1024x768 screen</p>
	    <p>I'd have to double check the specs. It used to have like 1.5GB of RAM but one of the sticks stopped working and kept it from booting.</p>

			<h2>Windows 98 computer</h2>
			<p>Redfox TX-5IB2 motherboard, with 2 USB headers and a PS/2 header. AT to PS/2 adapter as well.</p>
			<p>Pentium 166Mhz, 32MB PC100 RAM, 16GB compact flash to IDE</p>
			<p>Diamond Stealth 3D 2000 Pro with 2MB VRAM although might get a Riva128 and a better CPU cooler later on.</p>
			<p>C-Media CMI8738 Sound card, mostly using for its soundblaster compatability and General MIDI support. May get a real Soundblaster 16 far down the line because some DOS games don't like my current card.</p>
			<p>Sometimes I will hook up IDE floppy drive and IDE CD-RW drive but most of the time I get away with mounting ISOs. If I try to play something like Command and Conquer from CD it'll just lock up but if I mount the ISO it works fine.</p>
			<p>I've been looking for a case to house it but right now they're too expensive and I'm not even sure I'll get the right one. Also the video output is very wobbly and wavy after I busted the last power supply. Hopefully it'll be fixed once I buy the different video card.</p>

			<h2>Oneplus 7 Pro</h2>
			<p>I've had this since about Feburary and it is an EXCELLENT phone for the most part. I have Havoc OS on it now and I love the screen covering the whole phone and the front camera coming out of the top. I am very anxious about a lot of things and it is nice knowing for sure when the front camera is being used. My dad had this phone before me and when he had it I had the Oneplus 7T which is also an excellent phone too. Oh and did I mention the 30 watt fast charge and in screen finger print sensor? I am sad there is no headphone jack but yeah I have to deal with it. Might need to get a new dongle because the right side gets static and I like to use my Sennheiser HD280's with my phone sometimes. The battery could use a replacement too but I still get away with 10-20% at the end of the day. I stay up at night or wake up early anyway so I blame it on myself, not the phone.</p>

			<h2>iPhone 4s</h2>
			<p>What can I say? To me it's basically a smaller iPhone 13. Tons of nostalgia from when my dad had the iPhone 4 when it was new. I have one that I broke the battery connector and another still running iOS 6 without any Coolbooter kerfuffle. I love the old design of iOS, I love tinkering with it, and I love to look the many things that are still possible to do on it.<p>

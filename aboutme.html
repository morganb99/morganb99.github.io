	<p  class="space-item">Maybe later on I'll be better at introducing myself. I'm 19 and I am studying in college to learn computer programming. I am pretty much obsessed with electronics and nostalgia so I work with new and old computer games. I also like Asian stuff and love my two cats at least some of the time. I can read a bit of Japanese and Spanish but I'm not very good at speaking it. I also use Arch Linux a lot. I will use Windows from time to time when I need more battery life on my laptop during class or I'm playing certain games but I love using the terminal, especially to write this very code in Vim or Kate. I also played the violin for a pretty long time and I was OK at it. Got too burned out and didn't want to play it anymore but perhaps I'll get into it again some other time. Maybe guitar instead because I like my 2000s rock/metal.</p>

It's all AMD, technically two gpu's but much easier to setup in Linux than the ROG to use the better dedicated gpu. I think all you need to do is set an enviornment variable. I also have windows 11 for playing rdr2. It does run on proton but not very good imo. Games that I play on linux rn with this laptop include Doom Eternal, Minecraft Java and GTA Online.</p>
			<p>I can play better now with Proton GE.</p>

I also have a 200gb NTFS partition to keep files in so they are easily accessable from all operating systems. Battery life is about as bad as my ROG, like almost two hours even with a replacement battery I got.</p>

            <p>Battery used to last 2 minutes now it's cooked. The CMOS battery has died recently too. Fun laptop to burn CDs, play DVDs, trying to play games and do other stuff. I used to actually do my school work on it few years ago, browsing the Internet and everything. If I wanted to watch YouTube I'd use a website to download the video in 360p and watch in VLC. I programmed in Java for computer science and robotics on it. Better than using a Lenovo Chromebook with LANSchool spyware on it. Also I have two of these now.</p>

I actually have two of this computer but one has a fried CPU as well as the fried HDD, yeah. Only real difference is one has an MSI motherboard I think instead of Gigabyte but both came with 8gb of RAM so now I have 16gb DDR4 which is pretty safe standard for me. I also have a 1tb toshiba drive in the computer too, I've got several harddrives these past few years from goodwill, often they're in plastic enclosures with USB.</p>

			<p>I've had this since about Feburary and it is an EXCELLENT phone for the most part. I have Lineage OS 20 on it now and I love the screen covering the whole phone and the front camera coming out of the top. I am very anxious about a lot of things and it is nice knowing for sure when the front camera is being used. My dad had this phone before me and when he had it I had the Oneplus 7T which is also an excellent phone too. Oh and did I mention the 30 watt fast charge and in screen finger print sensor? I am sad there is no headphone jack but yeah I have to deal with it. For earbuds I use the fiio fd1 with a usb c dongle. Also I have switched the battery like a million times, rn I get 4, 5 hours of screen on time, 12 or so hours total.</p>

			<p>It's the original Xenon model on latest firmware and there aren't any mod chips I know of that will work on it. It has a 20gb hdd on it and I have one of the wireless controllers with the chatpad. I had the xbox 360 a lot before this one so I already have a bunch of games digitally and on disc. Occasionally I play GTA IV on it because I never got to play it before and it is a pain to run a cracked copy on PC.</p>

		<div class="grid-item" style="border: 0px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
			<p>I kind of already wanted a slightly newer Xbox 360 later on so I could have one with the HDMI port, more storage, or just one that is compatible with the available modchips out there. I got the Xenon from ebay but this Falcon/Elite model is from a local Goodwill electronics store. It said that everything was tested but when I got it home the disc drive wouldn't read any games, just acted like I had no disc inside. It still had the seal inside so I took it apart to clean out the fans and eventually replaced the drive like I originally did with the Xenon. The Xenon was already having E74 errors here and there and occasional RROD but now it kept doing that so perfect oppurtunity to switch over the drive from that. I have to resolder wires as the driver board cannot be replaced or it'll only be able to read DVDs I think. But yeah I might be able to do an RGH mod to it, the equipment to do it isn't too expensive but it's possible that I attempt to do it.</p>
